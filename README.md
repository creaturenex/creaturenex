My name is Oscar Romero and I am a software engineer. I am fascinated by the creativity and fusion of software and hardware. I am a maker and have messed with all sorts of stuff like building a pc/hackintosh, arduinos, raspberry piâ€™s, LEDs, 3D printers and woodworking. I have fun making and breaking things. I love learning and looking for opportunities to learn and grow with others.
