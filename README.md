My name is Oscar Romero and I am building the necessary skills to become a software engineer. My background as an engineer in the biopharma industry built great problem solving skills. After taking time to reflect on my future career, I  wanted to follow my passion to create. The melding of hardware and software and bringing life to your ideas is what excites me the most.

I am accomplishing this through the Launch School Program. Don't worry you will be hearing from me soon!
